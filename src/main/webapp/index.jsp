<h2>Hello Siddique !</h2>

<p>This is my NextWork web application working!</p>

<p>If you see this line in Github, that means your latest changes are getting pushed to your cloud repo :o</p>

<p>If you see this line, one more time....that means your latest changes are automatically deployed into production by CodePipeline!</p>

<p> This is additional line i just appended to my code to see - how my AWS CodePipeline reacts to code change and deploy it into production <p>
<p> This is new line </p>
